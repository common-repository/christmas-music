Get some Christmas mood for your website!


== Description ==

**Get some Christmas mood for your website!**

This plugin adds the most Christmassy music to your site or the pages of your selection. The soft Jingle Bells tune will amp up the feeling of the holidays coming.

The music starts playing automatically if the client browser settings allow so. To help the visitors find the play button if they have blocked autoplay, you can add the tooltip pointing to the button.

Just tick the Add “Enable Xmas Mood” tooltip box on the Christmas Music Settings page of your dashboard, and the small popup prompt will appear right above the button.

## Color & visibility settings

The button in the right lower part of your site enables users to pause and resume the music whenever they want. In case you prefer to hide the button, we’ve provided a checkbox where you can specify that. Doing that, make sure you configure the plugin to play the music automatically.

Also, you can set the colors on the button to fit your interface! The color pickers on the plugin settings page let you select the colors for the background and the pause/play icon on the button. Note that the button colors appear transparent and only change opacity on hover.

## Music availability settings

Spread the Christmas mood as far across your site as you wish: the song doesn’t have to play everywhere if you don’t feel it should. Set the tune to play on the entire site or limit it to a certain page or post – up to you! To enable the plugin only on selected pages, make sure:

- You have the Play on all pages (entire website) option unticked on the Christmas Music Settings page

- You specified your preferences on the page of your choice

## More customization

Want to personalize your Christmas Music plugin even more?

- Use your own music files
- Configure the volume level
- Turn autoplay off optionally
- Choose the play button position
- Choose the button's style
- Add animation to the button

With the latest update, we added lots of awesome features to the FREE version:

1. **Change the Jingle Bells tune to any music you prefer**

	Simply upload an MP3 or WAV file (WAV files are currently not suppported in Internet Explorer and Edge browsers) and let your users enjoy the song of your choice!

2. **Adjust the music volume**

	The default level is 30, which is considered optimal for most of the people. However, if you feel that music should be louder or quieter, adjust the volume with the slider on the plugin settings page.

3. **Configure the pause/play button and its functionality**

	Autoplay can catch some by surprise. If you’re afraid of being too pushy with it, you can set the plugin to keep the music turned off unless the user clicks Play. The Play button can be circle or square, and to make it more noticeable, there’s a soft pulsing animation available - the nicest way to attract users’ attention.

	And this button doesn’t have to be in the lower right corner! You define what works best with your layout: assign the spot for it in the settings.

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin.
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress


== Frequently asked questions ==

= Is it possible to enable Christmas Music on some specific pages only? =

Yes, definitely. See screenshots above to find out how to set it up, it is really easy.

= Is it possible to choose another audio file? =

Yes, we’ve updated the plugin so that you can do that in the free edition.

= Is seamless play possible? =

It is not possible to have a fully “seamless” flow because WordPress is a PHP-based CMS and pages are being reloaded when switching. But we managed to store the state of the current playtime before the reload and keep playing from that point once the new page loaded.
